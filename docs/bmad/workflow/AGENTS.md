## üìù **Agent Usage Best Practices**

### **Effective Prompting**
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and requirements
- **Include Constraints**: Mention technical, business, or time constraints
- **Reference Documentation**: Point to relevant PRD, architecture, or story docs
- **Ask Follow-ups**: Use iterative questioning for detailed guidance

### **Context Sharing**
- **Current State**: Always describe what exists now
- **Desired State**: Clearly articulate what you want to achieve
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define what success looks like
- **Dependencies**: Mention any blocking or related work

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Cross-Reference**: Validate agent suggestions against project standards

## üîß **Cursor IDE Integration**

### **Setting Up BMAD Agents in Cursor**

1. **Agent Profiles**: Configure each agent as a specialized assistant
2. **Context Files**: Use the generated BMAD documentation as context
3. **Project Understanding**: Agents understand the modular architecture
4. **Story Templates**: Use standardized story format for consistency

### **Workflow Integration**

```typescript
// Example: Using @dev agent for implementation
/*
@dev I'm implementing Story 1.1 Bundle Size Optimization. 

Current state: Bundle is 45KB gzipped
Target: Reduce to <40KB gzipped
Constraints: 
- Cannot break existing functionality
- Must maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Performance must improve, not degrade

Please help me:
1. Analyze current bundle structure
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Provide specific implementation steps
4. Suggest testing approach

Context files: 
- docs/bmad/stories/epic-1-performance/story-1.1-bundle-optimization.md
- packages/pim-bundle/src/index.ts
*/
```
