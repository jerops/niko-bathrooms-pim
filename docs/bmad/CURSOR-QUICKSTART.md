# BMAD Method - Cursor IDE Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Quick Setup for Development with BMAD

Since you have the project cloned in Cursor, here's how to immediately start using BMAD Method for development.

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps in Cursor**

### **Step 1: Switch to BMAD Branch**
```bash
# In Cursor terminal
git checkout bmad-method-integration
git pull origin bmad-method-integration
```

### **Step 2: Review BMAD Documentation**
Open these key files in Cursor to understand the current setup:
- `docs/bmad/README.md` - Overview of BMAD implementation
- `docs/bmad/PRD.md` - Complete product requirements
- `docs/bmad/Architecture.md` - Technical architecture
- `docs/bmad/workflow/AGENTS.md` - Agent usage guide

### **Step 3: Start with First Story Implementation**
We recommend starting with **Story 1.1: Bundle Size Optimization** as your first BMAD story:
- Open: `docs/bmad/stories/epic-1-performance/story-1.1-bundle-optimization.md`
- This story is ready for implementation and has all context needed

## 🤖 **Using BMAD Agents in Cursor**

### **Agent Interaction Pattern**
```typescript
// Example: Start with @dev agent for Story 1.1
/*
@dev I want to implement Story 1.1: Bundle Size Optimization

Current situation:
- Bundle is currently ~45KB gzipped
- Target: Reduce to <40KB gzipped  
- Cannot break existing functionality
- All tests must continue to pass

Context files I'm working with:
- docs/bmad/stories/epic-1-performance/story-1.1-bundle-optimization.md
- packages/pim-bundle/src/index.ts
- packages/*/package.json (all packages)

Please help me:
1. Analyze current bundle composition
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Create implementation plan
4. Suggest specific code changes

What should I start with first?
*/
```

### **Recommended Agent Workflow for Story 1.1**

#### **Phase 1: Analysis (@architect)**
```typescript
/*
@architect I need to analyze the current bundle structure for optimization.

Looking at the modular architecture:
- auth/ (~15KB)
- wishlist/ (~12KB) 
- user-management/ (~10KB)
- Other packages (~8KB total)

Questions:
1. Which packages have the most optimization potential?
2. Are there unnecessary dependencies between packages?
3. What tree-shaking opportunities exist?
4. Should we split large packages into core + advanced?

Please analyze the current architecture and suggest optimization strategy.
*/
```

#### **Phase 2: Implementation Planning (@dev)**
```typescript
/*
@dev Based on the architecture analysis, help me implement bundle optimization.

Current bundle structure shows opportunities in:
- Large auth package (15KB) 
- Dependencies between packages
- Potential dead code

Implementation plan needed for:
1. Tree-shaking optimization
2. Package splitting (core vs advanced features)
3. Dynamic imports for non-critical features
4. Webpack/Rollup configuration updates

Please provide specific implementation steps and code examples.
*/
```

#### **Phase 3: Quality Validation (@qa)**
```typescript
/*
@qa I'm implementing bundle optimization changes and need testing strategy.

Changes being made:
- Tree-shaking improvements
- Package splitting
- Dynamic imports

Testing needed:
1. Bundle size validation (<40KB target)
2. Functionality regression testing
3. Performance testing
4. Cross-browser compatibility

Please help create comprehensive test plan and validation criteria.
*/
```

## 🚨 **If You Get Stuck**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **"Story seems overwhelming"**
- Break it into smaller chunks
- Start with analysis phase only
- Use agents for step-by-step guidance
- Focus on one acceptance criterion at a time

#### **"Not sure about technical approach"**
- Consult @architect agent first
- Review existing codebase patterns
- Start with smallest change first
- Ask for specific code examples

#### **"Tests are failing"**
- Use @qa agent for debugging help
- Review story requirements vs implementation
- Check for missing edge cases
- Verify environment setup

### **Getting Help**
- **Technical Questions**: Use @architect or @dev agents
- **Process Questions**: Reference workflow documentation
- **Quality Issues**: Consult @qa agent
- **Scope Questions**: Review PRD and story requirements
