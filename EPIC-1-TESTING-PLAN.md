- [ ] Tree shaking working correctly
- [ ] 89.3% size reduction achieved
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

### **Story 1.2: Lazy Loading Implementation**
- [ ] Wishlist package builds successfully
- [ ] Notifications package builds successfully
- [ ] Core bundles load immediately
- [ ] Advanced bundles load on demand
- [ ] Critical path < 25KB
- [ ] 65% load time improvement achieved

### **Story 1.3: CDN Optimization**
- [ ] PIM bundle builds successfully
- [ ] CDN configuration generated
- [ ] Performance testing passes
- [ ] Cache headers optimized
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms working
- [ ] Global performance targets met

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Build All Packages**
```bash
# Test auth package
cd packages/auth
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:bundle-size

# Test wishlist package
cd packages/wishlist
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:bundle-size

# Test notifications package
cd packages/notifications
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:bundle-size

# Test PIM bundle
cd packages/pim-bundle
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:bundle-size
```

### **Step 2: Validate Bundle Sizes**
- Check that all bundles meet size targets
- Verify tree shaking is working
- Confirm lazy loading is implemented

### **Step 3: Test CDN Configuration**
```bash
cd packages/pim-bundle
pnpm run deploy:cdn
pnpm run test:cdn-performance
```

### **Step 4: Integration Testing**
- Test that all packages work together
- Verify critical path loads first
- Test advanced features load on demand
- Confirm no breaking changes

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Bundle Sizes**
- Auth Core: ~0.40KB
- Auth Advanced: ~0.63KB
- Wishlist Core: ~3KB
- Wishlist Advanced: ~9KB
- Notifications Core: ~2KB
- Notifications Advanced: ~6KB
- Critical Path: ~8.6KB
- Total Reduction: 89.3%

### **Performance Metrics**
- Load Time Improvement: 65%
- Cache Hit Rate: >95%
- Global Load Time: <1.5s
- Bandwidth Reduction: 30%
- Edge Cache Coverage: >90%

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
- Build failures: Check dependencies and TypeScript config
- Bundle size issues: Verify tree shaking and imports
- CDN issues: Check network connectivity and URLs
- Integration issues: Verify package exports and imports

### **Success Criteria**
- All packages build without errors
- Bundle sizes meet or exceed targets
- Performance improvements validated
- CDN optimization working
- Integration testing passes
- No breaking changes introduced

## 📝 Test Results

### **Story 1.1: Bundle Size Optimization** ✅ **PASSED**
- **Auth Package**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**
  - Core: 0.40KB (target: <8KB) ✅
  - Advanced: 0.63KB (target: <7KB) ✅  
  - Total: 1.61KB (target: <40KB) ✅
  - **Reduction**: 89.3% from original 15KB ✅
  - **Status**: All targets exceeded significantly

### **Story 1.2: Lazy Loading Implementation** ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
- **Wishlist Package**: ⚠️ **NEEDS OPTIMIZATION**
  - Core: 4.84KB (target: <3KB) ❌
  - Advanced: 6.77KB (target: <9KB) ✅
  - Main: 16.42KB (target: <12KB) ❌
  - Total: 28.04KB (target: <12KB) ❌
  - **Status**: Bundle splitting works, but sizes need optimization

- **Notifications Package**: ✅ **BUILDS SUCCESSFULLY**
  - Build completed with TypeScript warnings
  - Bundle splitting implemented
  - **Status**: Ready for size testing

### **Story 1.3: CDN Optimization** ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS**
- **PIM Bundle**: ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY ISSUES**
  - Auth bundles: ✅ Build successfully
  - Wishlist/Notifications bundles: ❌ Module resolution errors
  - **Status**: Need to fix package exports and dependencies

## 🎯 **Overall Epic 1 Status: 60% Complete**

### **✅ What's Working:**
1. **Auth package optimization** - Exceeds all targets
2. **Bundle splitting architecture** - Successfully implemented
3. **Lazy loading framework** - Core/Advanced pattern working
4. **Build systems** - Rollup and Webpack configurations functional

### **⚠️ What Needs Work:**
1. **Wishlist package sizes** - Need further optimization
2. **Package exports** - Core/Advanced modules not properly exported
3. **PIM bundle dependencies** - Module resolution issues
4. **Bundle size targets** - Some packages exceed targets

### **🔧 Next Steps:**
1. Fix package exports for core/advanced modules
2. Optimize wishlist bundle sizes
3. Resolve PIM bundle dependency issues
4. Complete CDN optimization testing
5. Validate all performance targets
